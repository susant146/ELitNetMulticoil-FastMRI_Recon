# ELitNetPlus-MRI_Recon

Accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) through undersampled k-space acquisition offers the potential to reduce long scan times for conventional MR imaging. Deep learning-based reconstruction methods have emerged as a powerful tool for addressing this challenge. However, the widely adopted practice of increasing network depth and parameters to boost performance often results in significant energy consumption, making them impractical for resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose ELiTNet+, an Energy-efficient, Lightweight, and computationally Thin Network enhanced with an attention mechanism to compensate for reduced parameter capacity. By incorporating layer-wise attention, the network selectively focuses on relevant structures, enhancing the robustness in MR image reconstruction despite its compact design. The inclusion of consistent gradient as multi-loss function ensures preservation of fine textures and small details, resulting in quantitative improvement in PSNR and SSIM metrics over baseline U-Net and ViT models. The results highlight the viability of ELiTNet+ as an efficient and effective solution for accelerated MRI reconstruction, balancing high performance with low energy demands.
